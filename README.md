# Predicting-MLB-Games-with-Machine-Learning
Combine classification algorithms to predict the winner of each game

Kyle Johnson

For the Module 3 Final Project, we are tasked with creating a classification model to be used on real world situations. I have chosen to attempt to predict Major League Basebal games in such a way that is better than the Vegas book makers. Being able to get 60% of games correct is of no use if Vegas also predicted those same games correctly; in order to have a useful model, I must create one that consistently makes money when betting against Vegas bookmakers.

Please use this notebook as a road map through this project and walk through the corresponding notebooks in order for a full understanding of the process.

# Conclusions:
-I was able to create a model that predicts MLB games more accurately and more profitably than the Vegas odds in a statistically significant way. I did this by querying data from several online baseball databases and then optimizing several different classification models, before combining them to vote on the outcome of each game.

-Oddly enough, it seems that always betting with the Vegas odds is a profitable strategy but using the model created in this project is potentially almose twice as profitable.
# Future Work:
For further exploration, I would use more types of data (new and highly advanced statistics) and more games from previous seasons. I would also automate the process of gathering the necessary data for today's games and publishing a report of which games to bet on.
